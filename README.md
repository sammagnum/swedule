Using this to formulate a plan step by step:

First he says to record yourself spitting balling your idea with yourself, I did that. Here is a cleaned up summary based on that recording :


I would like to design a wep app that allows people to request vacation time and see their schedule for the upcoming week.Teamleads should be able to approve/deny that request. The request page should be able to show how many request your team has made and the request limit for your team. their should be a warning system indicating if folks are reaching their max use for the year. schedule should be based on the timezone of computer and fall back to est. have a dropdown to adjust timezone. you should be able to view your team schedule as well. A primary part of the goal is having a clean interface that does not require notes to view. I also would like to be able to import the current database, but not being able to is not a deal killer. However, teamlead definitely could use an easy way to import. I want to avoid w3 integration for now so will likely,need its on login. I want to add email notification at some point but thats later.
